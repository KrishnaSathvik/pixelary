## What's actually new with GPT Image 2

OpenAI launched GPT Image 2 (also branded as ChatGPT Images 2.0) on April 21, 2026. It's the third generation of OpenAI's image models, following GPT Image 1 (April 2025) and GPT Image 1.5 (December 2025).

The two genuinely new capabilities are:

1. **Built-in reasoning before generation.** This is the first OpenAI image model to integrate O-series reasoning into the image pipeline. Before generating, the model analyzes the prompt, plans the composition, and reasons about constraints — which is why it handles complex layered prompts (UI mockups, multi-element layouts, scenes with text) much better than its predecessors.

2. **Multilingual text rendering at production quality.** Text inside images now renders accurately across Latin, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Bengali, and Arabic scripts. Independent reviews put accuracy above 95% on first-generation attempts. Mixed-script layouts (Japanese poster with English brand name, etc.) actually work now — they didn't in any previous model.

The model is available in ChatGPT, Codex, and the API. Pricing on the API is $5 per million text input tokens, $8 per million image input tokens, and $30 per million image output tokens — which works out to roughly $0.006 to $0.21 per generated image depending on quality and resolution. (Source: OpenAI pricing page, April 2026.)

This article gives you 12 prompts that work well with GPT Image 2's reasoning model — battle-tested across the categories most creators care about.

## The structural pattern these prompts follow

Every prompt below shares the same underlying structure:

[Subject + specifics] + [Action] + [Environment + cultural anchor] + [Composition] + [Lighting] + [Style/medium]

For photoreal: add camera body, lens, aperture. For text in images, wrap the copy in quotes and specify font/weight/color/placement. For edits, use the CHANGE / PRESERVE / MATCH structure.

This is a synthesis of patterns we've seen work across hundreds of prompts — not an industry standard, but a useful framework for thinking about what's missing in any given prompt.

## 1. Event poster

**Rough idea:** "poster for a tech conference"

**Polished prompt:**

\`\`\`
Minimalist event poster, 2:3 portrait. Headline "FUTURE STACK" in bold condensed sans-serif, ALL CAPS, off-white, upper third. Subtitle "MARCH 14 — 16 • 2026" in thin sans-serif below, same color, letter-spacing 0.2em. Visual: single thin line arcing across the lower third connecting two small filled circles. Background: deep charcoal (#1A1A1A). Generous negative space, Swiss design aesthetic. Verbatim text — no extra characters, no duplicate text, no text artifacts.
\`\`\`

**Why it works:** All text is in quotes with placement, weight, and color locked. The hex code prevents palette drift. "Swiss design aesthetic" handles composition without needing more rules.

## 2. Process flow infographic

**Rough idea:** "infographic showing a 4-stage workflow"

**Polished prompt:**

\`\`\`
Horizontal 4-stage pipeline diagram, 16:9 landscape, white background. Four rounded rectangles equally spaced left to right, each labeled in bold sans-serif: "PLAN", "BUILD", "TEST", "SHIP". Above each rectangle: a simple isometric line icon. Beneath each: a 2-word descriptor in dark gray sans-serif. Thin arrows between stages. Header at top: "Project Workflow" in bold sans-serif, dark navy.
\`\`\`

**Why it works:** Layout topology is stated upfront. Each stage has explicit fill, label, and icon. Connectors specified. The model handles the rest.

## 3. Web dashboard mockup

**Rough idea:** "dashboard mockup for a SaaS analytics product"

**Polished prompt:**

\`\`\`
MacBook Pro 14" screen mockup at 16:10 aspect, dark theme. Generic SaaS analytics dashboard. Top nav: logo placeholder left, tabs "Overview · Reports · Users · Settings" center, profile avatar right. Main: 4 KPI cards showing "12.4K Active Users", "847 New Signups", "$2,341 MRR", "62% Engagement" with cyan sparklines. Below: line chart "Activity — Last 30 Days". Right sidebar: "Top 5 Channels" list. Background: deep navy (#0F1729). Accent: cyan (#06B6D4). shadcn/ui aesthetic.
\`\`\`

**Why it works:** Specific device frame, specific component layout, specific data. The shadcn reference handles styling without you having to describe every spacing decision.

## 4. LinkedIn carousel slide

**Rough idea:** "slide with a stat about productivity"

**Polished prompt:**

\`\`\`
LinkedIn carousel slide, 4:5 portrait, off-white background (#F7F3EC). Massive headline filling the upper two-thirds: "Workers spend 21.8 hours per week in meetings." in bold condensed sans-serif, dark navy, left-aligned. Beneath, on a single line: "Most of them are unnecessary." in thin italic serif, same navy. Lower-left corner: small text "Slide 1 of 7" in tiny gray sans-serif.
\`\`\`

**Why it works:** The stat-as-hook follows what actually performs on LinkedIn. Two-tier typography (bold + italic serif) creates rhythm. Negative space gives the eye room.

## 5. Cinematic still

**Rough idea:** "cinematic shot of a wedding"

**Polished prompt:**

\`\`\`
Cinematic still, 2.39:1 anamorphic. Bride in flowing ivory dress sits on a low garden bench in a courtyard at dusk, hands resting in her lap, looking off-frame to the right. Background: blurred warm string lights, scattered flowers. Shot at 50mm, f/1.8, eye-level, medium close-up. Lighting: warm tungsten string lights from above-right creating soft rim, ambient blue-hour fill. Color grade: teal-orange, slightly desaturated. Kodak Portra 400 grain. Mood: contemplative, intimate.
\`\`\`

**Why it works:** Pose, gaze direction, and clothing are specific. 50mm + f/1.8 locks the cinematic feel. Two named light sources prevent flat lighting.

## 6. Interior photograph

**Rough idea:** "calm reading nook"

**Polished prompt:**

\`\`\`
Interior photograph, 4:5 portrait. Reading nook built into a bay window. Window seat with deep cushion in oatmeal linen, two earth-tone pillows. Built-in bookshelves on both sides, dark wood. Single brass swing-arm reading lamp mounted left. Worn leather-bound book lies open face-down on cushion. Soft north-facing morning light through window, sheer linen curtains diffusing it. Shot at 35mm, f/4. Architectural digest editorial style. No people.
\`\`\`

**Why it works:** Specific materials throughout. Light source named with quality. The worn book detail makes it feel lived-in.

## 7. Food photography

**Rough idea:** "breakfast spread"

**Polished prompt:**

\`\`\`
Overhead flat-lay food photograph, 1:1 square, 90-degree top-down angle. Breakfast spread on a wooden table. Center: stack of fluffy pancakes with maple syrup, butter melting on top. Around it: crispy bacon, scrambled eggs, mixed berries, glass of orange juice, ceramic mug of black coffee with steam wisps. Scattered mint leaves and halved orange as styling. Soft window light from upper-left. Shot at 50mm, f/5.6. Editorial food photography, slightly rustic.
\`\`\`

**Why it works:** Universal breakfast items recognizable across cultures. Specific positioning. Light direction named.

## 8. Background swap edit

**Rough idea:** "change my photo's background to a rainy city at night"

**Polished prompt:**

\`\`\`
CHANGE: Replace the background with a rainy city street at night — neon signs reflecting on wet pavement, blurred passing cars, soft bokeh from illuminated signage, light rain visible against dark sky.

PRESERVE: Subject's face, pose, hair, clothing, body framing, skin tones, and exact silhouette — locked exactly as in source.

MATCH: Original lighting direction and intensity on subject (rim from camera-right). Color temperature on subject stays neutral but reflections on clothing/skin should subtly pick up cool blue and magenta from the new neon environment. Match original film grain.
\`\`\`

**Why it works:** The PRESERVE list is exhaustive — every locked element named. The MATCH block prevents the "pasted in" look by addressing color spill from the new environment.

## 4 more shorter examples

**Concept art:** \`Concept art illustration, 16:9 cinematic, matte painting style. Sprawling low-profile research facility built into the side of a rocky crater on an alien planet, glowing blue lights through narrow window slits, solar arrays across rust-red plain. Two figures in white pressure suits walking toward an airlock. Sky: dusty pink with two small moons.\`

**Magazine cover:** \`Editorial magazine cover, 8.5x11 portrait. Masthead "WANDER" in bold sans-serif, white, top center. Headline "Mountains at Dawn" in elegant serif italic, lower left third. Sub-headline "12 hidden viewpoints" in thin sans-serif beneath. Cover photo: silhouetted mountain range against deep blue-to-orange gradient sky.\`

**Comparison infographic:** \`Two-column comparison infographic, 4:5 portrait. Left header "OPTION A" in blue (#2B6CB0); right header "OPTION B" in amber (#D69E2E). Vertical divider. Five rows: Speed / Cost / Flexibility / Best For / Trade-off. Statements max 6 words each.\`

**Object removal edit:** \`CHANGE: Remove the green trash can in lower-left and the power line crossing the upper third. Reconstruct the wall behind using existing brick pattern; reconstruct sky as clean continuous gradient. PRESERVE: Every person, the storefront awning, parked car, street signs, sidewalk, all shadows. MATCH: Golden hour from camera-right, warm temperature, film grain.\`

## How to use these

Don't just copy them verbatim. Use them as templates: find the example closest to your use case, swap out the subject specifics for your own, keep the structural skeleton (camera specs, lighting language, aspect ratio), and iterate by changing one variable at a time.

Or paste your rough idea into [Depikt](/generate) and let it generate the structured prompt for you.

## What changed with reasoning-based image models

GPT Image 2 launched April 21, 2026 with built-in reasoning before generation. This is the first OpenAI image model that analyzes a prompt before rendering — which means prompt structure matters more than keyword density.

Older guides (written for DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, or even GPT Image 1.5) emphasize keyword stacking: "8K, ultra-detailed, masterpiece, hyper-realistic." That advice is no longer ideal. With a reasoning model, those adjectives compete with the structural information you actually want the model to attend to.

Here are 10 techniques that work better.

## 1. Drop adjective stacking

"Stunning," "beautiful," "breathtaking," "masterpiece," "8K," "ultra-detailed," "hyper-realistic," "epic" — these add no information. Replace them with observable physical detail.

Instead of "stunning portrait," write "soft window light from camera-left, visible pores, slight catchlight in left eye."

## 2. Describe the photograph, not the fantasy

Imagine you're describing a real photograph someone took. Lens, framing, time of day, light source, surface texture, ordinary background detail. Real photographs have constraints — and the model produces better outputs when satisfying realistic constraints than when asked to produce "amazing art."

## 3. Use camera language for photoreal

For any photoreal output, name a focal length and aperture:

- 24mm f/8 — wide architectural / landscape
- 35mm f/2.8 — documentary / street
- 50mm f/1.8 — natural perspective / portrait
- 85mm f/1.4 — flattering portrait / fashion
- 100mm macro f/2.8 — product / food close-up

These specs are visual shorthand the model has learned from millions of captioned photos.

## 4. Wrap text in quotes and specify placement

Even with GPT Image 2's improved text rendering, structure helps. The protocol that works:

- Wrap exact copy in quotes or ALL CAPS
- Specify font style, weight, color, placement
- Add "verbatim — no extra characters, no substitutions" for accuracy-critical text
- End with "no duplicate text, no text artifacts"

## 5. Stack concrete constraints

GPT Image 2 reliably handles multiple distinct constraints in a single prompt — its reasoning layer means it can satisfy more without dropping any. Use this to your advantage.

Don't write: "a modern living room."

Write: "a craftsman-style living room with oak built-ins, oatmeal linen sofa, brass swing-arm lamp from camera-left, north-facing morning light, hardwood floor, small Persian rug, single open book on a side table, no people."

## 6. Use cultural and temporal anchors

You don't have to describe everything. Name a cultural moment and the model fills in the details:

- "1990s grunge era"
- "1985 izakaya"
- "dot-com era 1999"
- "rural village during monsoon season"

This triggers world knowledge — the model knows what these scenes look like, and you get specificity for free.

## 7. Specify aspect ratio explicitly

Always end your prompt with the aspect ratio that matches your use case:

- 16:9 — landscape, web hero, YouTube
- 9:16 — vertical story, TikTok
- 4:5 — feed posts
- 1:1 — profile, square social
- 2:3 — Pinterest, magazine
- 2.39:1 — anamorphic cinematic

Default ratios are unpredictable. Lock it.

## 8. For edits: CHANGE / PRESERVE / MATCH

Image edits drift unless you use a strict structure:

- CHANGE: the one thing you want different
- PRESERVE: the explicit list of everything that must stay
- MATCH: the lighting, color temperature, grain logic to maintain

Restate the PRESERVE list every iteration — drift compounds.

## 9. Avoid living artist names

Beyond ethics, naming living artists produces inconsistent outputs. Use art disciplines, eras, or movements instead:

- "Bauhaus poster design"
- "Swiss editorial style"
- "Memphis Group"
- "mid-century modern illustration"

## 10. Iterate one variable at a time

Don't change four things between generations. You'll never know which change fixed (or broke) the output.

When iterating, keep everything constant except one element — light direction, OR aspect ratio, OR color palette. This is how you actually learn what each lever does.

## The faster path

If running through this checklist on every prompt sounds like work, [Depikt](/generate) automates these techniques. Paste a rough idea, get back a structured prompt that has already applied each technique.

    title: "A 6-Layer Framework for Writing AI Image Prompts",

## Why structure beats keywords

Most prompt advice gives you keywords or example outputs. Neither helps when you sit down to write your own prompt for your own scene.

What helps is structure — a checklist you can run through to make sure your prompt isn't missing anything obvious. This framework isn't an industry standard, just a practical synthesis of what tends to be present in prompts that produce good results.

## The 6 layers

[Subject + specifics] + [Action / Pose] + [Environment + cultural anchor] + [Composition: shot, angle, aspect ratio] + [Lighting: quality + direction + temperature] + [Style / Medium]

Most failed prompts skip 3-4 of these layers.

## Layer 1: Subject + specifics

Not "a man." Not "a coffee shop." A man is too vague — the model picks the most generic interpretation. Add: age, build, clothing material, hair, expression, posture.

A coffee shop is too vague. Add: era, city, time of day, occupancy, signage.

The rule: if a stranger could draw 50 different pictures from your description, your subject layer is too thin.

## Layer 2: Action / pose

What is the subject doing? Standing isn't enough. Standing how? Hands where? Looking where?

This layer matters most for human subjects and scene compositions. For object photography it can collapse to "centered, slight tilt to the right."

Be specific about gaze direction — "looking off-frame to the camera-left" reads completely differently from "looking directly at the camera."

## Layer 3: Environment + cultural anchor

Where, when, what's around. This is where cultural anchors do massive heavy lifting:

- "a coffee shop in 1990s grunge era"
- "a busy office during dot-com 1999"
- "a noodle bar in 1985 Tokyo"

Each anchor gives the model a thousand visual associations for free. Use them.

## Layer 4: Composition

Shot type, angle, aspect ratio. The vocabulary you need:

**Shot type:** extreme close-up, close-up, medium close-up, medium shot, medium wide, wide, extreme wide, aerial, top-down flat-lay.

**Angle:** eye-level, low-angle, high-angle, dutch angle, bird's-eye, worm's-eye.

**Aspect ratio:** always state it. 16:9, 9:16, 4:5, 1:1, 3:2, 2.39:1.

## Layer 5: Lighting

The single highest-impact lever in any prompt. Three variables:

**Quality:** soft / harsh / diffused / dappled / specular.

**Direction:** front / side / back / rim / from camera-left / from above / from below.

**Temperature:** warm tungsten / cool daylight / golden hour / blue hour / overcast / mixed.

Always name at least one explicit light source. "Soft window light from camera-left" is gold. "Good lighting" is useless.

## Layer 6: Style / medium

This is where you tell the model whether you want photoreal, illustration, or something stylized. Use art disciplines, not artist names:

- Photoreal: name a film stock — "Kodak Portra 400, fine grain"
- Editorial: "magazine editorial style, slightly desaturated"
- Illustration: "watercolor, visible paper texture, soft color bleeds"
- Vector: "flat vector illustration, 2-color palette"
- Concept art: "matte painting, painterly atmosphere"

## The framework in action

Watch the same idea evolve through the layers:

**Layer 0 (typical thin prompt):** "a hiker on a mountain"

**With Subject:** "Solo hiker in faded red windbreaker"

**Add Action:** "...walking away from camera on a sandstone trail"

**Add Environment:** "...in a desert canyon at golden hour"

**Add Composition:** "Low-angle wide shot at 24mm, 3:2 aspect"

**Add Lighting:** "Long shadows raking across the rock, warm rim light from camera-right"

**Add Style:** "Documentary travel photography, Kodak Portra 400 grain"

**Final stacked prompt:**

\`\`\`
Solo hiker in faded red windbreaker walking away from camera on a sandstone trail in a desert canyon at golden hour. Long shadows raking across the rock, distant rock formations visible in middle distance. Low-angle wide shot at 24mm, f/8, 3:2 aspect. Warm rim light from camera-right, dust catching in the light. Documentary travel photography, Kodak Portra 400 grain.
\`\`\`

## Where the framework breaks (and what to use instead)

Three categories need a different structure:

**Image edits:** Use CHANGE / PRESERVE / MATCH instead. The 6-layer formula doesn't apply because you're not generating from scratch.

**Typography-heavy posters:** Lead with text (in quotes, with placement), then add the visual layer using layers 3-6. Subject and action collapse.

**Abstract / experimental work:** Photographic vocabulary actively hurts abstract output. Use medium + mood + palette + composition instead, with art-movement anchors instead of camera specs.

For everything else — photoreal, cinematic, character art, interiors, food, fashion, architecture — the 6 layers work as a useful checklist.

## Use the framework or use Depikt

You can apply this manually on every prompt. Or you can paste your rough idea into [Depikt](/generate) and get a structured 6-layer prompt back in seconds. Same framework, automated.

    content: `
## What actually changed with text rendering

For years, text inside AI-generated images was unreliable. Garbled letters, made-up characters, hybrid hallucinations. This was the running joke of the industry, and the main reason these tools were unusable for branding, posters, or anything with copy.

GPT Image 2 fixed most of it. Independent reviews of the April 21, 2026 launch put text accuracy above 95% across Latin, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Bengali, and Arabic scripts. PetaPixel called it the first AI image model where text rendering "actually works for production." OpenAI's announcement specifically highlighted text rendering as one of the model's three core upgrades.

But "above 95%" still leaves room for errors. And if you don't follow the protocol below, your hit rate drops fast. Here's what works.

## Rule 1: Wrap exact copy in quotes

Never write: \`a poster that says data night\`

Always write: \`a poster with the headline "DATA NIGHT" displayed prominently\`

Quotation marks tell the model: this is the literal string. Not a description. Not a theme. Render exactly these characters.

## Rule 2: Specify font style, weight, color, placement

The model has to make four decisions about every text element. Don't leave them to chance:

- **Style:** sans-serif, serif, display serif, condensed sans, monospace, handwritten, italic
- **Weight:** thin, regular, bold, black
- **Color:** name a hex code (#0F1729) or descriptive color (off-white, deep navy)
- **Placement:** upper third, centered, lower-left corner, vertical along right edge

Example: \`Subtitle "MARCH 14" in thin sans-serif, off-white, lower third, letter-spacing 0.2em\`

## Rule 3: Use the "verbatim" trigger

For accuracy-critical text — brand names, dates, prices, taglines — append this phrase:

\`Verbatim text — no extra characters, no substitutions, no duplicate text, no text artifacts.\`

This works because GPT Image 2's reasoning layer attends to explicit constraints. The phrase has become a common pattern in the prompt engineering community for a reason — it lowers the error rate noticeably on critical text.

## Rule 4: Spell out unusual brand names

If your brand name has unusual letter combinations or made-up words, spell it letter by letter on first reference:

\`Logo "WANDER" (W-A-N-D-E-R) in bold sans-serif, white\`

Overkill for common words, but lifesaving for brand names the model might "correct" to a real word.

## Rule 5: Don't ask for paragraphs

Image models are not document layout engines. Asking for "a paragraph of body text below the headline" produces gibberish that looks like text but isn't.

If you need real paragraph text in a layout, use the right tool — Figma, Canva, or InDesign — and use the AI for the visual elements only.

## What still doesn't work reliably

Even with the protocol, three things remain inconsistent:

1. **Existing brand logos** — the model can't reproduce specific real-world logos (Nike swoosh, etc.) accurately. Composite them in Figma.
2. **Long-form text** — paragraphs, lists, or any text over ~10 words. Generate the visual, add text after.
3. **Mixed languages** — mixing scripts (Latin + Hindi + Chinese in one image) often produces errors in one or more scripts, though GPT Image 2 does better at this than any previous model.

## Putting it together

Here's a complete text-heavy prompt that follows the full protocol:

\`\`\`
Minimalist event poster, 2:3 portrait. Headline "FUTURE STACK" in bold condensed sans-serif, ALL CAPS, off-white (#F7F3EC), upper third. Subtitle "MARCH 14 — 16 • 2026" in thin sans-serif, off-white, below headline, letter-spacing 0.2em. Bottom-right corner: small attribution "Conference 2026" in tiny gray sans-serif. Background: deep navy (#0F1A2E). Generous negative space. Verbatim text — no extra characters, no substitutions, no duplicate text, no text artifacts.
\`\`\`

Three text elements, each with its own font weight, color, and placement. Hex codes for color lock. The verbatim trigger at the end.

## The shortcut

Manually applying this protocol on every prompt is tedious. [Depikt](/generate) bakes the entire text-rendering protocol into every poster, social graphic, and typography-heavy prompt it generates. Paste your rough idea, get back a prompt with quotes, placements, weights, and the verbatim trigger already in place.

- Highest character consistency across multiple generations (Identity Locking)
- Best for editing workflows that need precise control
- Native 4K resolution at faster speeds (8-12 seconds per image)
- Strong instruction adherence for "make it exactly like this" tasks
- Pay-per-image pricing with batch discounts (50% off official rates)

**Weaknesses:**
- Style and aesthetic less distinctive — outputs can feel restrained
- Not as strong on artistic or stylized work
- Less unified product surface (split across multiple Google products)

**Best for:** Image edits, character continuity across a series, product photography, controllable workflows where you need exactly what you described.

## Midjourney V8 — the artistic standard

V8 Alpha launched March 17, 2026 with a ground-up architectural rebuild (switched from TPUs to GPUs with PyTorch codebase). V8.1 followed in mid-April.

**Verified capabilities:**
- Native 2K (2048x2048) generation — upgraded from V7's 1024x1024
- Improved text rendering and semantic understanding vs V7
- Web platform available alongside Discord
- Subscription pricing: $10-$120/month
- Stealth Mode available on Pro and Mega plans

**Strengths:**
- Most consistently impressive default aesthetic
- Best cinematic mood, atmosphere, and color grading
- Strong for moody portraits, fantasy, and concept art
- Distinctive artistic signature
- Style references (--sref) and character references (--cref) for consistency

**Weaknesses:**
- Text rendering still trails GPT Image 2 (handles short words like "STOP" or "CAFE" but struggles with longer text or specific font layouts)
- Less prompt adherence than GPT Image 2 or Nano Banana Pro
- No public API for standard users — enterprise customers can negotiate custom API access
- 2K resolution is half the linear resolution of Nano Banana Pro's 4K
- Subscription model rather than pay-per-image

**Best for:** Cinematic stills, concept art, mood-driven imagery, fashion editorial, hero images, anything where artistic atmosphere matters more than precise instruction following.

## Quick decision guide

| Use case | Best model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Posters with text | GPT Image 2 | Highest text rendering accuracy across scripts |

| Multilingual content | GPT Image 2 | Mixed-script layouts work reliably |
| Image editing | GPT Image 2 or Nano Banana Pro | Both have strong editing — GPT Image 2 for natural-language edits, Nano Banana Pro for precise control |
| Character consistency | Nano Banana Pro | Identity Locking processes up to 14 references |
| Product photography | Nano Banana Pro | Best precision and control |
| 4K native output | Nano Banana Pro | Native 4K vs Midjourney's 2K |
| Cinematic / concept art | Midjourney V8 | Unmatched aesthetic atmosphere |
| Mood-driven hero imagery | Midjourney V8 | Default beauty without prompt engineering |
| Quick iteration / experimentation | Nano Banana Pro | Fast generation (8-12s for 4K) |

## The prompt translation problem

A prompt optimized for one model does not transfer cleanly to another:

- **GPT Image 2** rewards natural sentences with reasoning hooks ("Soft north-facing light because it's a craftsman home")
- **Midjourney V8** rewards keyword-weighted descriptions with parameters ("--ar 16:9 --style raw")
- **Nano Banana Pro** rewards literal precise descriptions with strong noun-verb structure

Switching models without rewriting your prompt typically underperforms by a meaningful margin. Most professional teams use 2-3 of these models, not just one.

A common stack:

1. **GPT Image 2** for structured outputs (posters, social graphics, UI, infographics)
2. **Midjourney V8** for hero imagery and cinematic stills
3. **Nano Banana Pro** for edits and precise iterations

This is more work than picking one — but the output quality difference is real, and the cost of using the wrong tool for a job is hours of bad iterations.

## What this means for your workflow

If you're picking just one in April 2026:

- **Default to GPT Image 2** for most production workflows — it has the strongest combination of capabilities and is improving fastest
- **Use Midjourney V8** when aesthetic quality is the entire point and you're not constrained by text rendering needs
- **Use Nano Banana Pro** when you need character consistency across a series or precise edits

[Depikt](/generate) generates prompts optimized specifically for GPT Image 2's reasoning style. If you're using GPT Image 2 as your primary model — which is the right default for most production teams in April 2026 — that's the leverage point.

    content: `
## Why editing is harder than generating

Generating an image from a prompt is a single-shot operation. The model has total freedom — it just needs to satisfy your constraints.

Editing is fundamentally different. You're asking the model to change one thing while keeping everything else identical. That's a much harder problem, because "everything else" is a massive set of visual properties: lighting angle, color temperature, skin tones, fabric texture, shadow direction, grain structure, focal plane, and thousands of other details you don't consciously notice until they change.

Without structure, edits drift. Skin tones shift. Backgrounds bleed into subjects. Hair changes texture. Shadows point the wrong way. The result looks "pasted in" — which is worse than just generating from scratch.

## The framework: CHANGE / PRESERVE / MATCH

Every edit prompt should have exactly three blocks:

**CHANGE:** The one thing (or small set of things) you want different. Be specific about what replaces what.

**PRESERVE:** An explicit, exhaustive list of everything that must stay exactly the same. If you don't name it, the model may change it.

**MATCH:** The lighting, color, and grain logic that bridges the old and new elements. This is what prevents the "pasted in" look.

## Why three blocks, not two

Most people write edit prompts with just CHANGE and PRESERVE. They skip MATCH — and that's where the uncanny results come from.

When you swap a studio background for a rainy street, the subject's lighting shouldn't stay studio-flat. The new environment should cast subtle color spill onto the subject — cool blue from neon, warm orange from streetlights. Without the MATCH block, the model either keeps the original lighting (subject looks pasted) or re-lights everything (subject's face changes).

MATCH tells the model: keep the original lighting direction and intensity on the subject, but let the new environment influence color temperature and reflections naturally.

## Example 1: Background swap

**Rough idea:** "Put this portrait in a rainy Tokyo street at night"

\`\`\`
CHANGE: Replace the background with a rainy Tokyo street at night —
neon signs reflecting on wet pavement, blurred passing pedestrians,
soft bokeh from illuminated signage, light rain visible against
dark sky.

PRESERVE: Subject's face, expression, pose, hair, clothing, body
framing, skin tones, and exact silhouette — locked as in source.

MATCH: Keep original lighting direction on subject (rim from
camera-right). Subject's color temperature stays neutral, but add
subtle cool blue and magenta reflections on clothing and skin from
neon environment. Match original film grain and depth of field.
\`\`\`

## Example 2: Object removal

**Rough idea:** "Remove the trash can and power lines"

\`\`\`
CHANGE: Remove the green trash can in lower-left corner and the
power line crossing the upper third. Reconstruct the wall behind
the trash can using the existing brick pattern. Reconstruct the
sky as a clean continuous gradient matching the surrounding area.

PRESERVE: Every person, the storefront awning, parked car,
street signs, sidewalk texture, all cast shadows, window
reflections, and wall graffiti.

MATCH: Golden hour lighting from camera-right, warm color
temperature, existing film grain and vignette.
\`\`\`

## Example 3: Style transfer

**Rough idea:** "Make this photo look like a watercolor"

\`\`\`
CHANGE: Convert the photographic style to loose watercolor
painting — visible paper texture, soft wet-on-wet color bleeds,
unpainted white areas where highlights fall, slightly imprecise
edges.

PRESERVE: Composition, subject placement, relative proportions,
facial features and expression, clothing silhouette, background
element positions.

MATCH: Maintain the same value structure (darks and lights in the
same places). Simplify the color palette to 5-6 watercolor-plausible
hues. Preserve the original light direction through shadow placement.
\`\`\`

## Multi-turn editing: the drift problem

Single edits are manageable. The real challenge is multi-turn editing — making 3, 4, 5 changes to the same image across multiple generations. Each turn introduces small drift, and drift compounds.

By turn 3 or 4, the subject's face has subtly changed, the lighting is inconsistent, and the image has lost coherence.

**The fix: restate PRESERVE every turn.** Don't rely on the model remembering what to keep from previous turns. Copy-paste your full PRESERVE block into every edit prompt, updated to include anything new you added in previous turns.

**The second fix: work from the best previous output, not the original.** Each edit should reference the most recent good result, not the original image. This keeps the edit chain grounded.

## When to edit vs. when to regenerate

Edit when:
- You like 80%+ of the image and want to fix one element
- The composition, pose, and lighting are right but a detail is wrong
- You need to swap a background or remove an object
- You're doing style transfer on a specific composition

Regenerate when:
- The composition is fundamentally wrong
- Multiple major elements need changing
- The pose or framing doesn't work
- You're on edit turn 4+ and drift has accumulated

Regenerating with a refined prompt is often faster than fixing a broken edit chain.

## Common editing failures and fixes

**"Pasted in" look:** You're missing the MATCH block. Add color spill, reflection, and grain matching from the new environment.

**Face drift after 2-3 edits:** Your PRESERVE block isn't specific enough. Add: "facial bone structure, eye color, skin texture, exact hairline."

**Shadow inconsistency:** Name the light direction in MATCH. "Shadows cast to lower-left, consistent with key light from upper-right."

**Background bleeding into subject edges:** Add to PRESERVE: "exact silhouette edges, no feathering or blending at subject boundary."

**Grain mismatch:** Add to MATCH: "Match ISO grain structure and intensity of the source image."

## The shortcut

Writing CHANGE / PRESERVE / MATCH blocks manually is tedious, especially the exhaustive PRESERVE list. [Depikt's critique tool](/critique) can analyze your edit prompts and flag missing PRESERVE elements before you waste a generation on drift.

## Why most prompts underperform

The gap between a mediocre AI image and a good one is rarely about the model. It's about the prompt. And the same mistakes show up over and over — patterns that feel natural to write but consistently produce flat, generic, or incoherent results.

These aren't edge cases. They're the default way most people write prompts. Fixing them is the single highest-leverage thing you can do.

## Mistake 1: Adjective stacking

**The mistake:**
\`A stunning, beautiful, breathtaking, ultra-detailed, 8K masterpiece of a mountain landscape, hyper-realistic, epic, amazing\`

**Why it fails:** These adjectives carry no visual information. "Stunning" doesn't tell the model anything about composition, lighting, or color. With GPT Image 2's reasoning layer, these words actively compete with the structural details the model should be attending to.

**The fix:** Replace every adjective with an observable physical detail.

\`Mountain landscape at golden hour, long shadows raking across red sandstone, a single dead tree in the foreground, distant snow-capped peaks, thin cirrus clouds. Wide shot at 24mm, f/8, 3:2 landscape. Kodak Ektar 100.\`

## Mistake 2: No lighting direction

**The mistake:**
\`Portrait of a woman in a coffee shop, good lighting\`

**Why it fails:** "Good lighting" means nothing. The model picks the most generic, flat lighting it can — usually frontal and shadowless. Flat light kills depth and mood.

**The fix:** Name one specific light source with direction.

\`Portrait of a woman in a coffee shop, soft window light from camera-left, warm tungsten overhead creating slight rim on hair, shallow depth of field\`

One named light source transforms the entire image.

## Mistake 3: Vague subjects

**The mistake:**
\`A man standing in a city\`

**Why it fails:** A man could be anyone. A city could be anywhere. The model picks the most statistically average interpretation — and average is boring.

**The fix:** Add 3-4 specific details about the subject and 2-3 about the environment.

\`A tall man in his 30s wearing a worn olive field jacket, hands in pockets, looking off-frame to camera-left, standing on a rain-wet sidewalk in lower Manhattan at dusk, yellow taxi blurred in background\`

## Mistake 4: Ignoring aspect ratio

**The mistake:** Not specifying an aspect ratio and hoping the model picks the right one.

**Why it fails:** The model defaults to whatever ratio is most common in its training data for that subject — which is often wrong for your use case. A vertical story gets rendered as a landscape. A hero banner comes out square.

**The fix:** Always end with the exact ratio:

- **16:9** — web hero, YouTube thumbnail, landscape
- **9:16** — Instagram story, TikTok, vertical
- **4:5** — Instagram feed, portrait
- **1:1** — profile photo, square social
- **2:3** — Pinterest, print portrait
- **2.39:1** — cinematic widescreen

Lock it. Every time.

## Mistake 5: Asking for multiple competing styles

**The mistake:**
\`Watercolor painting, photorealistic, anime style, oil painting texture, digital art\`

**Why it fails:** Each style implies a completely different rendering approach. The model tries to satisfy all of them and produces a muddy hybrid that looks like none of them.

**The fix:** Pick one style and commit. If you want variations, generate separate images with different style specifications.

\`Loose watercolor painting on cold-press paper, visible brush strokes, wet-on-wet color bleeds at edges, limited palette of indigo, burnt sienna, and raw umber\`

## Mistake 6: Overloading text requests

**The mistake:**
\`A poster with the title, subtitle, three bullet points, a paragraph of body text, a footer with contact info, and a QR code\`

**Why it fails:** Image models are not layout engines. They can render 1-3 short text elements reliably. Beyond that, text degrades — characters garble, lines merge, spacing collapses.

**The fix:** Limit text to 1-3 elements, each with explicit placement and styling. For complex layouts with lots of text, generate the visual in AI and add text in Figma or Canva.

\`Event poster, 2:3 portrait. Headline "FUTURE STACK" in bold condensed sans-serif, white, upper third. Date "MARCH 14-16" in thin sans-serif below. Background: deep navy. Verbatim text — no extra characters.\`

## Mistake 7: Changing everything between iterations

**The mistake:** Getting a mediocre result and rewriting the entire prompt from scratch — changing the subject, composition, lighting, and style all at once.

**Why it fails:** When you change four variables simultaneously, you learn nothing. The next result might be better or worse, and you have no idea which change caused it.

**The fix:** Change one variable per iteration. Keep everything else constant. This is how you build intuition for what each lever actually does:

- **Iteration 1:** Change only the lighting direction
- **Iteration 2:** Change only the focal length
- **Iteration 3:** Change only the color palette

Slow iteration with single-variable changes beats fast iteration with random rewrites.

## The pattern behind all seven

Every mistake on this list is the same underlying error: giving the model vibes instead of constraints. "Stunning" is a vibe. "Soft window light from camera-left, f/1.8, 50mm" is a constraint.

AI image models produce better output when they're satisfying specific, concrete constraints than when they're trying to interpret abstract quality descriptors. The more precisely you constrain the image, the better it gets — which is counterintuitive but consistently true.

## Skip the mistakes

[Depikt](/generate) applies these fixes automatically. Paste a rough idea — even one that makes every mistake on this list — and get back a structured prompt that avoids all seven. It's the fastest way to stop wasting generations.

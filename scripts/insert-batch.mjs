    prompt: "A high-fashion cinematic portrait of a young woman with a thoughtful expression, looking slightly upward. The image is a deconstructed multimedia collage: her face is overlaid with faint, intricate architectural blueprints, geometric grid lines, and technical schematics. The composition features an explosive, splattered edge effect with charcoal and white paint strokes. Scattered hyper-realistic orange autumn maple leaves drift around her neck and hair. She wears a thick, textured brown knit scarf. High-contrast lighting, 8k resolution, ultra-sharp focus on the eyes, featuring hyper-realistic skin textures, muted earth-tone color palette with pops of vibrant orange, editorial photography style.",
    why_it_works: "Layering architectural blueprints and technical schematics over a portrait creates a unique mixed-media effect. The specific paint-splatter edge treatment, combined with hyper-realistic autumn leaves, gives the model clear textural contrasts to render. Earth tones with pops of orange provide a controlled color palette that feels cohesive.",

For the background, boldly arrange repetitive motifs such as abstract patterns, geometric shapes, dots, lines, spirals, swirls, and wave patterns to create an energetic composition reminiscent of street art or graffiti. For the colors, combine soft, pale pastel tones (pastel pink, mint green, lavender, light blue, etc.) to achieve both strong contrast and a light, airy feel. The drawing technique should primarily use uniform flat coloring, emphasizing thick, clean, and sharp outline lines. Avoid complex shading or gradients as much as possible, and instead create a graphical and dynamic impression through flat, vibrant color planes. Do not include any text, logos, or typography elements. Maintain the original illustration's composition and characters.",
    why_it_works: "Clear style directive: flat coloring with thick outlines, no gradients.
